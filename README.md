Raspberry Pi Common Library
=================

This library is intended to serve as a common ground for all micro-services that run on my Raspberry Pi's: it allows for
easier communication with the outside world and a more consistent way of building the software.

The class itself does not consist of runnable independent parts, it is only to be used by other software as a base.

Please note that this package is not in a stable version yet so it may introduce BC issues at anytime!
